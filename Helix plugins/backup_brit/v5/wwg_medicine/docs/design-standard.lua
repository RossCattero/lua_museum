/*
	The design standard for the Medical System.

	# Object structures;
	I've created a separate objects to make code compact and modificatable.

	# Object Modules(libs);
	I created a separate modules for each structure to keep some common methods outside and keep everything clean in structures.
	So, if developer want to access a global methods for any of objects - he can find it in libraries.
